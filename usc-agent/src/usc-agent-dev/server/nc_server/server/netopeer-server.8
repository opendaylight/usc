.SH NAME
netopeer-server \- NETCONF protocol server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B netopeer-server [\-dhV] [-v
.IB level ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B netopeer-server
is the NETCONF protocol server running as a system daemon. The
.B netopeer-server
is based on the libnetconf library. It provides an environment to run transAPI
modules for configuration a specific device or application according to its
data model.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B \-d
.RS
Run in daemon mode.
.RE
.PP
.B \-h
.RS
Show help.
.RE
.PP
.B \-V
.RS
Show program version.
.RE
.PP
.B \-v
.I level
.RS
Set the verbosity level. Possible values are from 0 (default) to 3. This
overrides any
.B NETOPEER_VERBOSE
environment variable.
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP NETOPEER_VERBOSE
Set the verbosity level. Possible values are from 0 (default) to 3. Overridden
by the
.B \-v
option.
.SH FILES
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/modules.conf.d/
.RS
Directory where the modules configuration files are stored. Note, that they
usually refers to various files in other locations.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/cfgnetopeer/*
.RS
Datastores, data models and validators for the
.B netopeer-server
internal modules.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/sshd_config
.RS
Template configuration for the
.B sshd(8)
instance used for accepting incoming NETCONF over SSH connections. Note, that
the template doesn't contain the listening address/port specification since
they are set automatically by the \fBnetopeer-server\fR according to the
configuration following \fIietf-netconf-server\fR data model.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/stunnel_config
.RS
Template configuration for the
.B stunnel(8)
instance used for accepting incoming NETCONF over TLS connections. Note, that
the template doesn't contain the listening address/port specification since
they are set automatically by the \fBnetopeer-server\fR according to the
configuration following \fIietf-netconf-server\fR data model.
.PP
This file is installed only if the \fBnetopeer-server\fR is compiled with the
\fB\-\-enable\-tls\fR option.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/stunnel/server.[crt|key|pem]
.RS
Server certificate for the netopeer
.B stunnel(8)
instance. This certificate is sent to a client during the TLS handshake.
.PP
These files are installed only if the \fBnetopeer-server\fR is compiled with the
\fB\-\-enable\-tls\fR option.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/stunnel/certs
.RS
Directory with the trusted Certificate Authority certificates for the netopeer
.B stunnel(8)
instance. These certificates are used for client certificate TLS verification.
.PP
This directory is installed only if the \fBnetopeer-server\fR is compiled with the
\fB\-\-enable\-tls\fR option.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/netopeer/stunnel/crl
.RS
Directory with Certificate Revocation Lists for the netopeer
.B stunnel(8)
instance. These CRLs are used during client certificate TLS verification when
checking if the certificate was not revocated by its issuer.
.PP
This directory is installed only if the \fBnetopeer-server\fR is compiled with the
\fB\-\-enable\-tls\fR option.
.RE
.PP
.I /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.liberouter.netopeer.conf
.RS
D-Bus configuration file for the services used by the \fBnetopeer-agent(1)\fR.
The location of the D-Bus configuration files can differ on different Linux
distributions, so the location can be changed by
\fB\-\-with\-dbus\-config\-dir\fR configure option.
.PP
This file is not installed if the \fBnetopeer-server\fR is compiled with the
\fB\-\-disable\-dbus\fR option.
.RE
.PP
.I /usr/share/dbus-1/system-services/org.liberouter.netopeer.server.service
.RS
D-Bus service file for automatic start of the \fBnetopeer-server\fR.
.PP
This file is not installed if the \fBnetopeer-server\fR is compiled with the
\fB\-\-disable\-dbus\fR and without \fB\-\-with\-dbus\-services\fR option.
Specifying the value of the second option, one can correct the default location
of the D-Bus service configuration files that can differ on different Linux
distributions.
.RE
.SS libnetconf files
.I /var/lib/libnetconf/datastore-acm.xml
.RS
Datastore file for the internal NETCONF Access Control module.
.RE
.PP
.I /dev/shm/sem.NCDS_FLOCK_*
.RS
Datastores locks used internally by the \fBlibnetconf\fR library.
.RE
.SH NETOPEER MODULES
TBD
.SH TROUBLESHOOTING
.SS Datastores dead lock
.PP
When the server crashes or is terminated with SIGKILL, it may happen that the
internal datastore locks stay locked. In such a case, the next time the
.B netopeer-server
(or any other libnetconf based application) tries to access the configuration
datastores, it freezes. To solve this problem, release the locks manually
removing the
.I /dev/shm/sem.NCDS_FLOCK_*
files.
