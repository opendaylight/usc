Dynamic netopeer-configurator modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

netopeer-configurator(1) dynamically loads any modules
it can find. The search begins by learning the directory
which 'config.py' module is in. This directory is then
searched for 'nc_*.py' files. These must include classes
with the same name as their file name without the
extension and conform to 'ncmodule.py'. All such modules
are imported.
