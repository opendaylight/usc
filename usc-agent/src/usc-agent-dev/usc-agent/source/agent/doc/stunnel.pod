=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<stunnel> program is designed to work as I<SSL> encryption wrapper 
between remote clients and local (I<inetd>-startable) or remote
servers. The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons running on
your system you can easily set them up to communicate with clients over
secure SSL channels.

B<stunnel> can be used to add SSL functionality to commonly used I<Inetd>
daemons like POP-2, POP-3, and IMAP servers, to standalone daemons like
NNTP, SMTP and HTTP, and in tunneling PPP over network sockets without
changes to the source code.

This product includes cryptographic software written by
Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com)

=head2 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<chroot> = DIRECTORY (Unix only)

directory to chroot B<stunnel> process

B<chroot> keeps B<stunnel> in chrooted jail.  I<CApath>, I<CRLpath>, I<pid>
and I<exec> are located inside the jail and the patches have to be relative
to the directory specified with B<chroot>.

Several functions of the operating system also need their files to be located within chroot jail, e.g.:

=over 4

=item *

Delayed resolver typically needs /etc/nsswitch.conf and /etc/resolv.conf.

=item *

Local time in log files needs /etc/timezone.

=item *

Some other functions may need devices, e.g. /dev/zero or /dev/null.

=back

=item B<compression> = deflate | zlib | rle

select data compression algorithm

default: no compression

deflate is the standard compression method as described in RFC 1951.

zlib compression of B<OpenSSL 0.9.8> or above is not backward compatible with
B<OpenSSL 0.9.7>.

rle compression is currently not implemented by the B<OpenSSL> library.

=item B<debug> = [FACILITY.]LEVEL

debugging level

Level is a one of the syslog level names or numbers
emerg (0), alert (1), crit (2), err (3), warning (4), notice (5),
info (6), or debug (7).  All logs for the specified level and
all levels numerically less than it will be shown.  Use I<debug = debug> or
I<debug = 7> for greatest debugging output.  The default is notice (5).

The syslog facility 'daemon' will be used unless a facility name is supplied.
(Facilities are not supported on Win32.)

Case is ignored for both facilities and levels.

=item B<EGD> = EGD_PATH (Unix only)

=head2 SERVICE-LEVEL OPTIONS

Each configuration section begins with service name in square brackets.
The service name is used for libwrap (TCP Wrappers) access control and lets
you distinguish B<stunnel> services in your log files.

Note that if you wish to run B<stunnel> in I<inetd> mode (where it
is provided a network socket by a server such as I<inetd>, I<xinetd>,
or I<tcpserver>) then you should read the section entitled I<INETD MODE>
below.


=over 4

=item B<accept> = [HOST:]PORT

accept connections on specified address

If no host specified, defaults to all IPv4 addresses for the local host.

To listen on all IPv6 addresses use:

    connect = :::PORT

=item B<CApath> = DIRECTORY

Certificate Authority directory

This is the directory in which B<stunnel> will look for certificates when using
the I<verify>.  Note that the certificates in this directory should be named
XXXXXXXX.0 where XXXXXXXX is the hash value of the DER encoded subject of the
cert.

The hash algorithm has been changed in B<OpenSSL 1.0.0>.  It is required to
c_rehash the directory on upgrade from B<OpenSSL 0.x.x> to B<OpenSSL 1.x.x>.

I<CApath> path is relative to I<chroot> directory if specified.

=item B<CAfile> = CERT_FILE

Certificate Authority file

This file contains multiple CA certificates, used with the I<verify>.

=item B<cert> = PEM_FILE

default: no (server mode)

=item B<connect> = [HOST:]PORT

connect to a remote address

If no host is specified, the host defaults to localhost.

Multiple B<connect> options are allowed in a single service section.

If host resolves to multiple addresses and/or if multiple I<connect>
options are specified, then the remote address is chosen using a
round-robin algorithm.

=item B<CRLpath> = DIRECTORY

Certificate Revocation Lists directory

This is the directory in which B<stunnel> will look for CRLs when
using the I<verify>. Note that the CRLs in this directory should
be named XXXXXXXX.r0 where XXXXXXXX is the hash value of the CRL.

The hash algorithm has been changed in B<OpenSSL 1.0.0>.  It is required to
c_rehash the directory on upgrade from B<OpenSSL 0.x.x> to B<OpenSSL 1.x.x>.

I<CRLpath> path is relative to I<chroot> directory if specified.

=item B<CRLfile> = CERT_FILE

Certificate Revocation Lists file

This file contains multiple CRLs, used with the I<verify>.

=item B<curve> = NID

To get a list of supported cuves use:

    openssl ecparam -list_curves

default: prime256v1

=item B<delay> = yes | no

delay DNS lookup for I<connect> option

This option is useful for dynamic DNS, or when DNS is not available during
B<stunnel> startup (road warrior VPN, dial-up configurations).

Delayed resolver mode is automatically engaged when stunnel fails to resolve on
startup any of the I<connect> targets for a service.

Delayed resolver inflicts I<failover = prio>.

default: no

REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_PORT, SSL_CLIENT_DN, SSL_CLIENT_I_DN.

=item B<execargs> = $0 $1 $2 ...

arguments for I<exec> including program name ($0)

Quoting is currently not supported.
Arguments are separated with arbitrary number of whitespaces.

=item B<failover> = rr | prio

Failover strategy for multiple "connect" targets.

    rr (round robin) - fair load distribution
    prio (priority) - use the order specified in config file

default: rr

=item B<ident> = USERNAME

use IDENT (RFC 1413) username checking

=item B<key> = KEY_FILE

private key for certificate specified with I<cert> option

Private key is needed to authenticate certificate owner.
Since this file should be kept secret it should only be readable
to its owner.  On Unix systems you can use the following command:

    chmod 600 keyfile

default: value of I<cert> option

=item B<libwrap> = yes | no

Enable or disable the use of /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny.

default: no (since version 5.00)

=item B<local> = HOST

IP of the outgoing interface is used as source for remote connections.
Use this option to bind a static local IP address, instead.

=item B<sni> = SERVICE:SERVER_PATTERN (server mode)

Use the service as a slave service (a name-based virtual server) for Server
Name Indication TLS extension (RFC 3546).

I<service_name> specifies the master service that accepts client connections
with I<accept> option.  I<server_name_pattern> specifies the host name to be
redirected.  The pattern may start with '*' character, e.g. '*.example.com'.
Multiple slave services are normally specified for a single master service.
I<sni> option can also be specified more than once within a single slave
service.

This service, as well as the master service, may not be configured in client
mode.

I<connect> option of the slave service is ignored when I<protocol> option is
specified, as I<protocol> connects remote host before TLS handshake.

Libwrap checks (Unix only) are performed twice: with master service name after
TCP connection is accepted, and with slave service name during TLS handshake.

Option I<sni> is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.0.0> and later.

=item B<sni> = SERVER (client mode)

Use the parameter as the value of TLS Server Name Indication (RFC 3546)
extension.

Option I<sni> is only available when compiled with B<OpenSSL 1.0.0> and later.

=item B<OCSP> = URL

select OCSP server for certificate verification

=item B<OCSPaia> = yes | no

This option enables I<stunnel> to validate certificates with the list of
OCSP responder URLs retrieved from their AIA (Authority Information Access)
extension.

=item B<OCSPflag> = OCSP_FLAG

specify OCSP server flag

Several I<OCSPflag> can be used to specify multiple flags.

currently supported flags: NOCERTS, NOINTERN NOSIGS, NOCHAIN, NOVERIFY,
NOEXPLICIT, NOCASIGN, NODELEGATED, NOCHECKS, TRUSTOTHER, RESPID_KEY, NOTIME

=item B<options> = SSL_OPTIONS

B<OpenSSL> library options

The parameter is the B<OpenSSL> option name as described in the
I<SSL_CTX_set_options(3ssl)> manual, but without I<SSL_OP_> prefix.
I<stunnel -options> lists the options found to be allowed in the
current combination of I<stunnel> and the I<OpenSSL> library used
to build it.

Several I<options> can be used to specify multiple options.
An option name can be prepended with a dash ("-") to disable the option.

For example, for compatibility with the erroneous Eudora SSL
implementation, the following option can be used:

    options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

default:

    options = NO_SSLv2
    options = NO_SSLv3

=item B<protocol> = PROTO

application protocol to negotiate SSL

This option enables initial, protocol-specific negotiation of the SSL/TLS
encryption.
I<protocol> option should not be used with SSL encryption on a separate port.

Currently supported protocols:

=item I<smtp>

Based on RFC 2487 - I<SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over TLS>

=item I<socks>

SOCKS versions 4, 4a, and 5 are supported.  The SOCKS protocol itself
is encapsulated within SSL/TLS encryption layer to protect the final
destination address.

F<http://www.openssh.com/txt/socks4.protocol>

F<http://www.openssh.com/txt/socks4a.protocol>

The BIND command of the SOCKS protocol is not supported.
The USERID parameter is ignored.

See Examples section for sample configuration files for VPN based on SOCKS
encryption.

=back

=item B<protocolAuthentication> = basic | ntlm

authentication type for protocol negotiations

Currently authentication type only applies to the 'connect' protocol.

default: basic

=item B<protocolHost> = HOST:PORT

destination address for protocol negotiations

I<protocolHost> specifies the final SSL server to be connected by the proxy,
and not the proxy server directly connected by B<stunnel>.
The proxy server should be specified with the 'connect' option.

Currently protocol destination address only applies to 'connect' protocol.

=item B<protocolPassword> = PASSWORD

password for protocol negotiations

=item B<protocolUsername> = USERNAME

username for protocol negotiations

=item B<PSKidentity> = IDENTITY

PSK identity for the PSK client

I<PSKidentity> can be used on B<stunnel> clients to select the PSK identity
used for authentication.  This option is ignored in server sections.

default: the first identity specified in the I<PSKsecrets> file.

=item B<PSKsecrets> = FILE

file with PSK identities and corresponding keys

Each line of the file in the following format:

    IDENTITY:KEY

The key is required to be at least 20 characters long.
The file should not be world-readable nor world-writable.

This option only works in server mode, and without protocol negotiation.

=item B<renegotiation> = yes | no

support SSL renegotiation

Applications of the SSL renegotiation include some authentication scenarios,
or re-keying long lasting connections.

On the other hand this feature can facilitate a trivial CPU-exhaustion
DoS attack:

F<http://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2011-ssl-dos-mitigation.html>

Please note that disabling SSL renegotiation does not fully mitigate
this issue.

default: yes (if supported by B<OpenSSL>)

=item B<reset> = yes | no

default: no

=item B<sessionCacheSize> = NUM_ENTRIES

session cache size

I<sessionCacheSize> specifies the maximum number of the internal session cache
entries.

The value of 0 can be used for unlimited size.  It is not recommended
for production use due to the risk of memory exhaustion DoS attack.

from the SSL client machine instead of the machine running B<stunnel>.

This option is currently available in:

=over 4

=item Remote mode (I<connect> option) on I<Linux E<gt>=2.6.28>

This configuration requires B<stunnel> to be executed as root and without
I<setuid> option.

This configuration requires the following setup for iptables and routing
(possibly in /etc/rc.local or equivalent file):

    iptables -t mangle -N DIVERT
    iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m socket -j DIVERT
    iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j MARK --set-mark 1
    iptables -t mangle -A DIVERT -j ACCEPT
    ip rule add fwmark 1 lookup 100
    ip route add local 0.0.0.0/0 dev lo table 100
    echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/lo/rp_filter

B<stunnel> must also to be executed as root and without I<setuid> option.

=item Remote mode (I<connect> option) on I<Linux 2.2.x>

This configuration requires kernel to be compiled with I<transparent proxy>
option.
Connected service must be installed on a separate host.
Routing towards the clients has to go through the B<stunnel> box.

B<stunnel> must also to be executed as root and without I<setuid> option.

=item Remote mode (I<connect> option) on I<FreeBSD E<gt>=8.0>

This configuration requires additional firewall and routing setup.
B<stunnel> must also to be executed as root and without I<setuid> option.

=item Local mode (I<exec> option)

This configuration works by pre-loading I<libstunnel.so> shared library.
_RLD_LIST environment variable is used on Tru64, and LD_PRELOAD variable on
other platforms.

=back

=item I<destination>

Original destination is used instead of I<connect> option.

A service section for transparent destination may look like this:

    [transparent]
    client=yes
    accept=<stunnel_port>
    transparent=destination

This configuration requires iptables setup to work,
possibly in /etc/rc.local or equivalent file.

For a connect target installed on the same host:

    /sbin/iptables -t nat -I OUTPUT -p tcp --dport <redirected_port> \
        -m ! --uid-owner <stunnel_user_id> \
        -j DNAT --to-destination <local_ip>:<stunnel_port>

For a connect target installed on a remote host:

    /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport <stunnel_port> -j ACCEPT
    /sbin/iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport <redirected_port> \
        -i eth0 -j DNAT --to-destination <local_ip>:<stunnel_port>

Transparent destination option is currently only supported on Linux.

=item I<both>

Use both I<source> and I<destination> transparent proxy.

=back

Two legacy options are also supported for backward compatibility:

=over 4

=item I<yes>

This options has been renamed to I<source>.

=item I<no>

This options has been renamed to I<none>.

=back


=item B<verify> = LEVEL

verify peer certificate

=over 4

=item level 0

Request and ignore peer certificate.

=item level 1

Verify peer certificate if present.

=item level 2

Verify peer certificate.

=item level 3

Verify peer with locally installed certificate.

=item level 4

Ignore CA chain and only verify peer certificate.

=item default

No verify.

=back

It is important to understand, that this option was solely designed for access
control and not for authorization.  Specifically for level 2 every non-revoked
certificate is accepted regardless of its Common Name.  For this reason a
dedicated CA should be used with level 2, and not a generic CA commonly used
for webservers.  Level 3 is preferred for point-to-point connections.

=back


=head1 RETURN VALUE

B<stunnel> returns zero on success, non-zero on error.


=head1 SIGNALS

The following signals can be used to control B<stunnel> in Unix environment:

=over 4

=item SIGHUP

Force a reload of the configuration file.

Some global options will not be reloaded:

=over 4

=item *

chroot

=item *

foreground

=item *

pid

=item *

setgid

=item *

setuid

=back

The use of 'setuid' option will also prevent B<stunnel> from binding privileged
(<1024) ports during configuration reloading.

When 'chroot' option is used, B<stunnel> will look for all its files (including
configuration file, certificates, log file and pid file) within the chroot
jail.

=item SIGUSR1

Close and reopen B<stunnel> log file.
This function can be used for log rotation.

=item SIGTERM, SIGQUIT, SIGINT

Shut B<stunnel> down.

=back

The result of sending any other signals to the server is undefined.


=head1 EXAMPLES

In order to provide SSL encapsulation to your local I<imapd> service, use:

    [imapd]
    accept = 993
    exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
    execargs = imapd

or in remote mode:

    [imapd]
    accept = 993
    connect = 143

In order to let your local e-mail client connect to an SSL-enabled I<imapd>
service on another server, configure the e-mail client to connect to localhost
on port 119 and use:

    [imap]
    client = yes
    accept = 143
    connect = servername:993

If you want to provide tunneling to your I<pppd> daemon on port 2020,
use something like:

    [vpn]
    accept = 2020
    exec = /usr/sbin/pppd
    execargs = pppd local
    pty = yes

If you want to use B<stunnel> in I<inetd> mode to launch your imapd
process, you'd use this I<stunnel.conf>.
Note there must be no I<[service_name]> section.

    exec = /usr/sbin/imapd
    execargs = imapd

To setup SOCKS VPN configure the following client service:

    [socks_client]
    client = yes
    accept = 127.0.0.1:1080
    connect = vpn_server:9080
    verify = 4
    CAfile = stunnel.pem

The corresponding configuration on the vpn_server host:

    [socks_server]
    protocol = socks
    accept = 9080
    cert = stunnel.pem

Now test your configuration on the client machine with:

    curl --socks4a localhost http://www.example.com/

=head1 NOTES

=head2 RESTRICTIONS

B<stunnel> cannot be used for the FTP daemon because of the nature
of the FTP protocol which utilizes multiple ports for data transfers.
There are available SSL-enabled versions of FTP and telnet daemons, however.


=head2 INETD MODE

The most common use of B<stunnel> is to listen on a network
port and establish communication with either a new port
via the connect option, or a new program via the I<exec> option.
However there is a special case when you wish to have
some other program accept incoming connections and
launch B<stunnel>, for example with I<inetd>, I<xinetd>,
or I<tcpserver>.

For example, if you have the following line in I<inetd.conf>:

    imaps stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/stunnel stunnel /etc/stunnel/imaps.conf

In these cases, the I<inetd>-style program is responsible
for binding a network socket (I<imaps> above) and handing
it to B<stunnel> when a connection is received.
Thus you do not want B<stunnel> to have any I<accept> option.
All the I<Service Level Options> should be placed in the
global options section, and no I<[service_name]> section
will be present.  See the I<EXAMPLES> section for example
configurations.

=head2 CERTIFICATES

Each SSL-enabled daemon needs to present a valid X.509 certificate
to the peer. It also needs a private key to decrypt the incoming
data. The easiest way to obtain a certificate and a key is to 
generate them with the free B<OpenSSL> package. You can find more
information on certificates generation on pages listed below.

The order of contents of the I<.pem> file is important.  It should contain the
unencrypted private key first, then a signed certificate (not certificate
request).  There should be also empty lines after certificate and private key.
Plaintext certificate information appended on the top of generated certificate
should be discarded. So the file should look like this:

    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    [encoded key]
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    [empty line]
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    [encoded certificate]
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    [empty line]

=head2 RANDOMNESS

B<stunnel> needs to seed the PRNG (pseudo random number generator) in
order for SSL to use good randomness.  The following sources are loaded
in order until sufficient random data has been gathered:

=over 4

=item *

The file specified with the I<RNDfile> flag.

=item *

The file specified by the RANDFILE environment variable, if set.

=item *

The file .rnd in your home directory, if RANDFILE not set.

=item *

The file specified with '--with-random' at compile time.

=item *

The contents of the screen if running on Windows.

=item *

The egd socket specified with the I<EGD> flag.

=item *

The egd socket specified with '--with-egd-sock' at compile time.

=item *

The /dev/urandom device.

=back

With recent (B<OpenSSL 0.9.5a> or later) version of SSL it will stop loading
random data automatically when sufficient entropy has been gathered.  With
previous versions it will continue to gather from all the above sources since
no SSL function exists to tell when enough data is available.

Note that on Windows machines that do not have console user interaction
(mouse movements, creating windows, etc.) the screen contents are not
variable enough to be sufficient, and you should provide a random file
for use with the I<RNDfile> flag.

Note that the file specified with the I<RNDfile> flag should contain
random data -- that means it should contain different information
each time B<stunnel> is run.  This is handled automatically
unless the I<RNDoverwrite> flag is used.  If you wish to update this file
manually, the I<openssl rand> command in recent versions of B<OpenSSL>,
would be useful.

Important note: If /dev/urandom is available, B<OpenSSL> often seeds the PRNG
with it while checking the random state.  On systems with /dev/urandom
B<OpenSSL> is likely to use it even though it is listed at the very bottom of
the list above.  This is the behaviour of B<OpenSSL> and not B<stunnel>.

=head2 DH PARAMETERS

Stunnel 4.40 and later contains hardcoded 2048-bit DH parameters.

It is also possible to specify DH parameters in the certificate file:

    openssl dhparam 2048 >> stunnel.pem

DH parameter generation may take several minutes.
