ABOUT
================================================================================
Libnetconf transAPI is a framework that will save developers time and let them
focus on configuring and managing their device instead of fighting with NETCONF
protocol.
It allows for a developer to choose parts of configuration that can easily be
configured as a single block. Based on a list of so-called 'sensitive paths',
enerator creates C code containing a single callback function for every
'sensitive path'. Whenever something changes in configuration file, appropriate
callback function is called and should reflect configuration changes to the
device behavior.

GETTING STARTED
================================================================================
1. Run python script 'lnctool'. Description of the parameters as follows:
		--model	Path to the main model.
		transapi	To say you want to generate files for a new transAPI module.
		--paths	File with the list of sensitive paths. One per line.
3. Open generated .c file and fill function bodies with code that has to be run
	when the configuration changes. You can add as many auxiliary functions as
	you need, but do NOT modify anything else.
4. Fill body of get_state_data() function so that it returns overall device
	state data defined in the device data model.
5. Run sequence 'autoreconf && ./configure && make'. If the build is succesful,
	a shared library is generated. You can use it with libnetconf for
	configuring your device.
