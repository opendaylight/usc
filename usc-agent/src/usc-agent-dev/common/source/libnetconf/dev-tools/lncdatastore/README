ABOUT
============================================
This small utility lets developers play with
libnetconf datastores. The main purpose is
to be able to see the actual model trees
built by ncds_consolidate() with all their
imports, augments and groupings resolved.

lncdatastore does not initialize libnetconf,
therefore is does NOT modify any actual
datastores or anything else. The loaded
models and the whole state are lost after
exit.
