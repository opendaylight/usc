Automatic server SSH key acceptance
-----------------------------------

If libnetconf is compiled with --enable-dnssec, this feature is possible.
What happens once a client tries to connect to a server is this:

- DNSSEC query is sent with the server hostname asking for SSHFP entries
- then any answers are carefully checked and then compared to
  the key fingerprint presented by the server
- only if an exact match is found and DNSSEC was used for the fingerprint
  retrieval is user input skipped and key is accepted (but it is NOT added
  into the known_hosts file!)
