/**
 * \page datastores Datastores Usage
 *
 * NETCONF defines usage of three datastores: running (mandatory),
 * startup (optional via :startup capability) and candidate (optional via
 * :candidate capability). libnetconf provides all these datastores.
 *
 * In addition to the described NETCONF point of view, libnetconf divides all
 * datastores (running, startup and candidate) into datastore parts connected
 * with a specific (basic) configuration data model. Each datastore part is
 * created by ncds_new(), ncds_new2() or ncds_new_transapi() function. According
 * to the specified datastore type, server should set up additional datastore
 * settings (see section \ref ds_settings). If some specific validation settings
 * are needed, ncds_set_validation() function can be used (more information
 * about validation can be found at a separated \ref validation "page". Finnaly,
 * to activate datastore and to get its unique identifier, ncds_init() function
 * must be called.
 *
 * If you want to use some data model that extends (by import or augment
 * statement) any of the used data models, functions ncds_add_model() or
 * ncds_add_models_path() can be used to specify location of the extension data
 * model(s). As ncds_new_transapi() connects base data model, its datastore and
 * transAPI module (for more information about transAPI, see \ref transapi
 * "separated page"), also an augment model can be connected with a transAPI
 * module using ncds_add_augment_transapi. In both cases, transAPI can be
 * provided not only as a shared object (*.so file), but also statically using
 * ncds_new_transapi_static() for base data model and
 * ncds_add_augment_transapi_static() in case of augment data model.
 *
 * By default, all features defined in configuration data models are disabled.
 * To enable specific features or all features at once, you can use
 * ncds_feature_enable() and ncds_features_enableall() functions.
 *
 * To finish changes made to the datastores (adding augment data models,
 * enabling and disabling features, etc.), server MUST call ncds_consolidate()
 * function.
 *
 * As a next step, device controlled by the server should be initialized. This
 * should includes copying startup configuration data into the running
 * datastore (and applying them to the current device settings).
 *
 * \anchor ds_settings
 * ## Datastore Settings ##
 *
 * - Empty Datastore (*NCDS_TYPE_EMPTY*)
 *
 *   There is no additional settings for this datastore type.
 *
 * - \ref fileds (*NCDS_TYPE_FILE*)
 *
 *   ncds_file_set_path() to set file to store datastore content.
 *
 * - \ref customds (*NCDS_TYPE_CUSTOM*)
 *
 *   This type of datastore implementation is provided by the server, not by
 *   libnetconf.
 *
 *   ncds_custom_set_data() sets server specific functions implementing the
 *   datastore. In this case, server is required to implement functions
 *   from #ncds_custom_funcs structure.
 *

/**
 * \page validation Data Validation
 *
 * [RFC6241]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241 "RFC 6241"
 *
 * [RFC 6241][RFC6241] defines NETCONF :validate capability intended to allow
 * validation of the configuration data. This capability specifies new operation
 * \<validate\> and adds \<test-option\> parameter to the \<edit-config\>
 * operation.
 *
 * On the client side, libnetconf allows to create \<validate\> RPC as well as
 * to specify \<test-option\> of \<edit-config\> RPC. When the :validate
 * capability is supported by the server, the default \<test-option\> value is
 * test-then-set, so each \<edit-config\> change is validated.
 *
 * On the server side, libnetconf performs data validation on \ref datastores
 * "datastore parts" that provides validators. libnetconf use Relax NG schema
 * to validate syntax of the datastore content and Schematron to check semantics.
 * Validators are loaded as a standalone files generated by *lnctool(1)*, which
 * is part of libnetconf standard instalation.
 *
 * libnetconf automatically searches for the validators during ncds_new() and
 * ncds_new_transapi() calls. Validators are supposed to be placed in the same
 * directory as data model provided to the mentioned function as its model_path
 * parameter. Alternatively, validators can be connected with the datastore
 * manually, using ncds_set_validation(). This function also allows to switch
 * off validation on a specific datastore part.
 *
 * ## lnctool(1) Usage ##
 *
 * Complete list of *lnctool(1)*'s options can be displayed using -h option:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * $ lnctool -h
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * *lnctool(1)* is used to perform the following 3 actions:
 *
 *   -# *convert* - converts YANG model to the YIN format
 *   -# *validation* - generates validation files for a given YANG data model
 *   -# *transapi* - prepares a transAPI module template
 *
 * Each next action includes all the previous actions, so executing the *transapi*
 * action generates also the YIN format of the data model and all the validation
 * files. More information about using *lnctool(1)* for creating a transAPI
 * modules can be found in the \ref transapi section. Here we focus on the
 * *validation* action.
 *
 * As the main input, you have to specify the main YANG data model of the
 * datastore (`--model` option). If there are also some augmenting models, you
 * should specify them as a parameter to the (multiple) `--augment-model`
 * option(s). If you need some imported data models, specify the path where to
 * search for them as the `--search-path` option.
 *
 * Based on a YANG data model, *lnctool(1)* generates all necessary files needed
 * by libnetconf. Basically, it generates YIN format of the data model required
 * by ncds_new() and ncds_new_transapi() functions. If you use some extension
 * models via ncds_add_model() or ncds_add_models_path(), you have to specify
 * also these models as *lnctool(1)*'s \<augment models\> parameter.
 *
 * The following commands generate validation files for the NACM data model:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * $ cd libnetconf/models/
 * $ lnctool --model ./ietf-netconf-acm.yang --output-dir ./nacm/ validation
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * The output directory `nacm/` now contains generated NACM data model in YIN
 * format, Relax NG schemas and Schematron XSL stylesheet for validation.
 *
 * Path to the search directory should be also specified in the server source
 * code to allow libnetconf to find imported data model (*ietf-yang-types.yin*
 * in this case).
 *
 * \note Return value checks are skipped in this example for simplicity. Do not
 * copy-paste this example. Also note, that NACM is one of internal libnetconf
 * datastores and it is not needed to add it manually by ncds_new(). This is
 * JUST a simple (stupid) example.
 *
 * <p></p>
 *
 * ~~~~~~~{.c}
 * ds = ncds_new(NCDS_TYPE_FILE, "./models/nacm/ietf-netconf-acm.yin", NULL);
 * ncds_file_set_path(ds, ds_path);
 * ncds_init(ds);
 * ncds_add_models_path("./models/");
 * ncds_consolidate();
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * If the validators files are stored in the same directory as
 * a basic data model (*ietf-netconf-acm.yin* in this case), libnetconf
 * automatically loads them during ncds_new() or ncds_new_transapi() calls. If
 * you store the validators files somewhere else, ncds_set_validation() function
 * can be used to specify their location:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~{.c}
 * ncds_set_validation(ds, 1, "./models/nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-data.rng", "./models/nacm/ietf-netconf-acm-schematron.xsl");
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * If validators files are not found or validation is switched off (via
 * ncds_set_validation() with enable parameter set to 0), validation is not
 * performed on such datastore part.
 *
 * ### Data Model Features ###
 *
 * When the data model includes some `feature` definition and corresponding
 * `if-feature` statement(s), all such features are enabled for validation
 * by default. If you want to enable only specific features (or disable all of
 * them), you have to use the *lnctool(1)*'s `--feature` option. The option
 * can be use multiple times and the given value has the following form:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * --feature module_name:feature_to_enable
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * If you want to disable all features of the module, use the following syntax:
 *
 * ~~~~~~~{.sh}
 * --feature module_name:
 * ~~~~~~~
 *
 * Remember that if you have some augmenting modules, you should also set
 * features of those augmenting modules.
