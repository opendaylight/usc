 * Note that reconnect_secs and reconnect_count parameters are used only before
 * a connection is established, then the function returns. It's up to the caller
 * to reconnect if the session goes down. It can be detected using returned PID.
 *
 * To make this function available, you have to include libnetconf_ssh.h or

 *
 * @param[in] host_list List of management servers descriptions where the
 * function will try to connect to.
 * @param[in] reconnect_secs Time delay in seconds between connection attempts
 * (even to the same server but it depends on reconnect_count). See
 * /netconf/ssh/call-home/applications/application/reconnect-strategy/interval-secs
 * value in ietf-netconf-server YANG data model.
 * @param[in] reconnect_count Number times the function tries to connect to a
 * single server before moving on to the next server in the host_list. See
 * /netconf/ssh/call-home/applications/application/reconnect-strategy/count-max
 * value in ietf-netconf-server YANG data model.
 * @param[in] server_path Optional parameter to specify path to the transport server.
 * If not specified, the function get transport protocol according to value
 * set by nc_session_transport() (default value is SSH transport). For the
 * NC_TRANSPORT_SSH the '/usr/sbin/sshd' path is used (OpenSSH server), in case
 * of NC_TRANSPORT_TLS the '/usr/sbin/stunnel' path is used (OpenSSL server).
 * @param[in] argv List of arguments to be used by execv() when starting the server
 * specified in server_path parameter. If server_path not specified (NULL), argv
 * is ignored. Remember, that the server is supposed to read data from stdin and
 * write data to stdout (inetd mode). So, for example sshd is running with -i
 * option.
 * @param[out] com_socket If not NULL, function returns TCP socket used for
 * Call Home connection. Caller is supposed to close returned socket when it is
 * no more needed.
 * @return -1 on error. In case of success, function forks the current process
 * running the transport protocol server and returns its PID.
