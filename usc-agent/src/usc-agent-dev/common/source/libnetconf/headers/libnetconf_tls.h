 * @ingroup tls
 * @brief Set paths to the client certificate and its private key
 *
 * This function takes effect only on client side. It must be used before
 * establishing NETCONF session (including call home) over TLS.
 *
 * This function is thread-safe. It is supposed to be part of the process of
 * establishing NETCONF session within a single thread:
 * -# Use nc_tls_init() to set client certificate and CA for server certificate
 * verification. Calling this function repeatedly with different parameters
 * changes those parameter for new NETCONF session created after the call. Any
 * currently used NETCONF session will be still using the settings specified
 * before the creation of the NETCONF session.
 * -# Establish NETCONF session using nc_session_connect(). If you don't need
 * to change parameters set in nc_tls_init(), you can call nc_session_connect()
 * repeatedly.
 * -# To properly clean all resources, call nc_tls_destroy(). It will destroy
 * TLS connection context in the current thread.
 *
 * @param[in] peer_cert Path to the file containing client certificate
 * @param[in] peer_key Path to the file containing private key for the client
 * certificate. If NULL, key is expected to be stored in the file specified in
 * cert parameter.
 * @param[in] CAfile Location of the CA certificate used to verify the server
 * certificates. For More info, see documentation for
 * SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() function from OpenSSL.
 * @param[in] CApath Location of the CA certificates used to verify the server
 * certificates. For More info, see documentation for
 * SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations() function from OpenSSL.
 * @param[in] CRLfile Location of the CRL certificate used to check for
 * revocated certificates.
 * @param[in] CRLpath Locarion of the CRL certificates used to check for
 * revocated certificates.
 * @return EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE
